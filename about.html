            In 1929, Jørgen Jørgensen, a Norwegian outdoor enthusiast, 
began his search for durable outdoor equipment to perform in Norway´s harsh and rugged land. 
Today, four generations later, RainyDays is still a family-owned and run company. This is RainyDays´s history.

Today, four generations later, as traditional mountain life broadens, we are still a family-owned and run company based near Oslo, Norway.

Our in-house team of designers and craftsmen is compelled to stretch the edges of innovation from concept to creation. 
We build touchstone products, establish construction techniques, and redefine the meaning of fit, fabric, function, and finish. 
based on our design principle of Loaded Minimalism™: great products made as clean as possible with all critical details.
Our drive for practical purity produces pioneering benchmarks. We created the original mountain tunnel tent, 
devised the standard monitoring system for backpacks, and were the first company to use Gore-Tex® in Europe.
